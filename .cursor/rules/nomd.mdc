description: No mds and small commits
alwaysApply: false

- Do not automatically create .md files. If you deem it necessary, ask the user if the creation is necessary.
- Make small commits. If a process is changing a lot of code, stop, ask if we should write tests for that specific feature, then test the feature then commit.
- Stay within the airBnB linter styling when writing code.
- Don't overly comment on simple functions, use comments only when a component necessitates it or would require explanation because it is too complex for a mid-senior level engineer to parse.
- Don't ever commit .md files unless it is the base README.md file.
