# Old Code Archive

This directory contains deprecated code files that are no longer in use but kept for reference.

## Files

- **PostgresRepository.old.js** - Original monolithic repository file before refactoring into modular TypeScript repositories. This file was replaced by the modular repository structure in `src/repositories/`.

## Note

These files are kept for historical reference only and should not be used in the application. The current implementation uses TypeScript repositories in `src/repositories/`.
